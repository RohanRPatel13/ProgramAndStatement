# ProgramAndStatement

## Objectives
1. Familiarity with writing a kernel class for a new type and its kernel operations (Program using Map and Statement).
2. Familiarity with writing a kernel class for a new type and its kernel operations (Statement using Tree).
3. Familiarity with alternative ways of testing software components.

## The Problem
The problem is to complete and carefully test implementations of the constructor and kernel methods defined in interfaces ProgramKernel and StatementKernel. These are the core components in the BL compiler.
